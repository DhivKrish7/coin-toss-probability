# coin-toss-probability

Just a simple python project to visually compare simulated vs mathematical probability using random coin tosses. It can simulates any number of coin tosses and checks how close the experimental results get to the ideal 0.5 mathematical probability for heads or tails by using matplotlib graphing.

## How-to-use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the 'ctpv.py' file
3. Enter the number of coin tosses you want to simulate (better go above 100)
4. It gives you a clean graph to see how simulated probability converges to 0.5

## Libraries-used
1. Random
2. Matplotlib
